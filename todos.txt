(1) Level Optimality 
  -- Not increasing in a significant or meaningful way.
  -- Plot is totally scattered, only a few things are updating to competence.
  -- Possibly a problem with the LO calculation being just on states in L.Ï€

(2) Cost function
  -- No change in routes at all.
  -- Autonomy and Human cost are simply way out of scale compared to movement.
  -- Consider either a more principled way of computing the above cost functions
     that would also increase them in a meaningful way, or alternatively
     lexicographic SSP?

(3) Transition Function
  -- For the domain model, change intersections to have probability of not moving
     similar to edges, to make it so that they don't have just "unit cost" all the time
     which is a problem.
